# Analysis-of-Twitter-Users--Perception-of-Competing-Video-Gaming-Consoles
Microsoft and SONY are two of the biggest players in the non hand-held console
gaming market with their feature products ‘Xbox’ & ‘PlayStation’ being 2 of the most
purchased gaming consoles globally in the last 2 decades.(Statista (2022)).
In November 2020, Microsoft released the “Xbox Series X”(Xbox) to rival SONY’s
“Playstation 5”(Ps5) released in same month.(The Economist (2020))

In this project, I analyzed tweets about the Playstation 5 and Xbox series X for a specific period to understand and compare twitter user's perception and sentiments towards both products.

Data was sourced using the ‘rtweet’ package in R
* 16470 tweets downloaded for Xbox Series X
* 34567 tweets downloaded for PlayStation 5
* Data considered tweets within 6-9 days leading up to November 24th 2022.
* English speaking markets were the focus of analysis
* I did a Preliminary Study to understand how users mention these products in
their tweets and used this to structure my keyword search as follows:

Xbox Series X search keywords:
“xbox series x”,“xboxseriesx” or #xboxseriesx

Playstation 5 search keywords:
“ps5”, “playstation 5”,“playstation5”, #playstation5 or #ps5
